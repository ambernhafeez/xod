/**
 * HOW IT WORKS AND HOW TO MAINTAIN IT
 *
 * First of all, middleware checks do we need to validate anything,
 * it calls `shallValidate` with passed into it Map of Functions
 * `shallValidateFunctions`. If it finds any function (key is an ActionType)
 * in this Map it will call it and get Boolean result (True to validate,
 * False to skip). If not found it's always True (validate).
 *
 * Then it will be validated either by `defaultValidateFunction` or one of
 * `shortValidators` and will merge new errors into previvous using one of merge
 * policies. See details below.
 *
 * There are three main points for improving validity hinting:
 *
 * 1. `shallValidateFunctions` is a Map of Functions, indexed by ActionType,
 *    where each function returns True (to validate) or False (to skip).
 *    If ActionType of dispatched Action is found in the Map it will be called
 *    with Action and Project as arguments. It provides an abillity to make a
 *    smart check "Do we need to validate it?".
 *    This Map is used in the `shallValidate` function. In case that there is no
 *    ActionType of dispatched Action, it will return True.
 *
 * 2. `shortValidators` is a Map of Functions, indexed by ActionTypes,
 *    where each function returns special object `ErrorsUpdateData`, that
 *    contains new Errors.
 *    All ActionTypes that aren't exist in this Map will be checked with
 *    default set of validators (see next point).
 *
 * 3. `defaultValidateFunctions` is a Map with only three keys: `nodes`, `pins`
 *    and `links`. Each key contains list of Functions that will validate this
 *    type of entity for some errors.
 *    This is a basic validation functions, that will used when there is no
 *    shortValidator for this ActionType.
 *    Each Function in a list should return a `Map EntityID (Map ErrorType [Error])`.
 *    Pay attention to the `ErrorType`. Conventionally, it should be equal to
 *    validate function name from `xod-project`. And it should be unique for
 *    each validate function.
 *
 * I HAVE ADDED NEW VALIDATOR INTO XOD-PROJECT, HOW TO ADD IT HERE?
 * Most important is to add it into `defaultValidateFunctions`, but you also have
 * to wrap it into another function, that will make a correct result format.
 * Open `validation.funcs.js` and add a new function here (see other validate
 * functions and do it in the similar way), scroll to the bottom and add it into
 * `defaultValidateFunctions` in the proper list.
 * If you done it right — it should work.
 *
 * I FOUND VERY SLOW CASE, HOW TO TWEAK PERFORMANCE?
 * There is two ways:
 * a). if some action could not break something in the Patch
 *     or Project, or could break it only in the specific cases,
 *     add a function (or just `R.F`) into `shallValidateFunctions`.
 * b). if action could break only specific things, add a short-circuit
 *     validate function into `shortValidators`.
 *
 * GOOD LUCK!

/**
 * A map of short-circuit validations and exceptions to the general rules
 * of validation.
 * For example of exception case see `PAT.PATCH_ADD`.
 *
 * Indexed by ActionTypes.
 * Should return `ErrorsUpdateData`.
 * ErrorsUpdateData :: { policy: UPDATE_ERRORS_POLICY, errors: Map PatchPath PatchErrors }
 *
 * A better and simpler way to produce this type is to apply `set*Policy` function
 * as the last step of a custom validation.
 * There are three policy rules:
 * `setMergePolicy`      - will merge new errors deeply inside previous errors.
 *                         It's handy when you check only one thing, not the whole
 *                         patch or patches.
 * `setAssocPolicy`      - will overwrite errors only for listed patch paths.
 *                         Use it when you validate some patches for all
 *                         possible errors. E.G. `validateLocalPatches`.
 * `setOverwritePolicy`  - will overwrite all errors with new ones.
 *                         Use it only when you validate the whole project,
 *                         including library patches.
 *
 * Signature for each function in this map:
 * :: Action -> Project -> Map PatchPath DeducedPinTypes -> Map PatchPath PatchErrors -> ErrorsUpdateData
 *
 * But there is a pack of utility functions, that make validation easier:
 *
 * To validate the changed Patch (that was referenced in the Action) and patches
 * that depends on the changed one, call:
 * validateChangedPatchesWith ::
 *    [NodeValidateFn] ->
 *    [PinValidateFn] ->
 *    [LinkValidateFn] ->
 *    Action ->
 *    Project ->
 *    Map PatchPath DeducedPinTypes ->
 *    Map PatchPath PatchErrors ->
 *    Map PatchPath PatchErrors
 *
 * To validate specific list of patches.
 * validatePatches ::
 *    [NodeValidateFn] ->
 *    [PinValidateFn] ->
 *    [LinkValidateFn] ->
 *    Project ->
 *    Map PatchPath DeducedPinTypes ->
 *    Map PatchPath PatchErrors ->
 *    [Patch] ->
 *    Map PatchPath PatchErrors
 *
 * To validate the changed Patch (that was referenced in the Action) and patches
 * that depends on the changed one, with default set of validate functions, call:
 * validateChangedPatches ::
 *    Action ->
 *    Project ->
 *    Map PatchPath DeducedPinTypes ->
 *    Map PatchPath PatchErrors ->
 *    Map PatchPath PatchErrors
 *
 * To validate specific patches with default set of validating functions
 * (like `validatePatches` but with predefined arrays of functions):
 * validatePatchesGenerally ::
 *    Project ->
 *    Map PatchPath DeducedPinTypes ->
 *    Map PatchPath PatchErrors ->
 *    [Patch] ->
 *    Map PatchPath PatchErrors
 *
 * To validate all local patches with default set of validating functions:
 * validateLocalPatches ::
 *    Project ->
 *    Map PatchPath DeducedPinTypes ->
 *    Map PatchPath PatchErrors ->
 *    Map PatchPath PatchErrors
 *
 *To validate all patches (including local and library) with default set:
 * validateAllPatches ::
 *    Project ->
 *    Map PatchPath DeducedPinTypes ->
 *    Map PatchPath PatchErrors ->
